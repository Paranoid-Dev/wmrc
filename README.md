# wmrc

A simple WM powered by wmutils, written in bash.

## Installation

_I'll get here eventually..._

## TODO

* Add a more easy way to configure it and its variables
* Add more layouts to dytyl
* Make cw work for floating layouts with wchg
* More complex group status indicator in lemonbar rather than just `mgfw -g $(pfw)`
* Example xinitrc and sxhkd configuration
* Void Linux template and potentially Arch Linux PKGBUILD
* Rewrite it all in something like Lua as bash is not a good language and shell scripting deserves death
* Allow for overrides of windows to keep them floating
* A lot of shit :(
